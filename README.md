# Tailwind Landing Page Template

A modern, responsive landing page template built with Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Features

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 19** with Server Components
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with custom theme
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Responsive Design** for all devices
- **Email Integration** with Resend

## Email Setup (Resend)

This project uses Resend for email form submissions. To set up email functionality:

### 1. Create Resend Account
- Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Get your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Verify Domain
- Add and verify `emergepremium.com` in your Resend dashboard
- This allows sending from `no-reply@emergepremium.com`

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

### 4. Vercel Deployment
Add the environment variable to your Vercel project:
- Go to your Vercel project settings
- Add `RESEND_API_KEY` with your API key value

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Support notes

This template has been developed with the App Router (`app`) and React Server Components. If you’re unfamiliar with these beta features, you can find more information about them on the Next.js beta documentation page. So, please note that any request dealing with React (e.g. extra features, customisations, et cetera) is to be considered out of the support scope.
